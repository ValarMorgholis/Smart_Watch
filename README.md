3. DS1307 (RTC (Real Time Clock) module with I2C interface)
4. DHT11 OR 22 (Digital Humidity and Temperature sensor)
5. Buzzer
6. LED
7. Push Button 5X
8. 10K Resistor (Pull down)


## You can see the full schematic here on the Wokwi simulator and actually run the program and interact with the button.
